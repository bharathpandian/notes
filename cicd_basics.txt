Test driven development 
=> first test cases are developed to faile and develop code to make it work 


Smoke test : tests the overall code is working in gigh level

Functional Test : does it do what the code suppose to do

Acceptance test : based on design document

unit test - this is to test a single piece of code , like function or method

integration test : how well the new code integrates with existing code 



Sonarube : code quality check -> bugs, code smell (badly written code), vulnerabilities
code Coverage : code covered during test cases  

CI:
compiling
dependency managemnt
executing automated tests
packaging the app for deployment 

Gradle is one among the build automation tool
