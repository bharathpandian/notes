### Architecture ###

master node / contrl plane 

API server 
control manager 
etcd 
scheduler 

Kubelet
kubeproxy 
container run time

SVC - service - stable network abstraction 
label selector defines where to route the traffic to .
when a service gets created and mapped with a pod using selector a object called endpoint will be created . ndpoint has the details of IP and Service name.

NodePort
ClusterIp
Loadbalancer

Service network is assigned for services - kubeproxy takes care of this 

Pod vs Node network

kubeproxy works as layer 4 LB 

when traffic flows from pod to hit  service it will flow through the cbr0 (bridge) - in kernel - and kubproxy uses IPVS - which is layer 4 LB
